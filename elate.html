      Hello. Before we start, I would just like to say that this is VERY LONG OVERDUE lol.
      I was supposed to send this to you on your birthday, but as you can see ummm it is a tad past that.
      Please note that most of the stuff has been worked on at various points in August and finishing touches and
      information have been added very recently. Anyway, you may proceed.
